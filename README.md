## ðŸš€ Live Dashboard

Check out the live app here: [Fakestore Streamlit Dashboard](https://app-dashboard-from-cloud-hosted-db-iivqqshzeaatetc7wcndz5.streamlit.app/)

This project extracted data from Fakestore API, transformed, cleaned, and loaded into a postgreSQL database locally, and on Supabase. From there, we are able to connect to the cloud hosted database from a python application and host a streamlit dashboard with altair visualizations on streamlit cloud. (link above)
